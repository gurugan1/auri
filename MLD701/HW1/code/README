----------------------

File descriptions

LANGFILE - Mention the language you are using in this file - octave/julia/python

Octave Implementation - Fill in the functions logPrior.m, logLikelihood.m and naiveBayesClassify.m
You can run your code using runNB.m. It's a helper script provided to you.

Julia Implementation - Fill in the code for all the functions in naivebayes.jl. runNB.jl is a
helper script provided for running the code.

Python Implementation - You need to fill out the code inside the runNB.py file. There
is minimal support for python. You would have to read in the data files and output the results
yourself. Your code should be able to run on the autolab servers. So please don't use libraries
that would not be available on the test sandbox.
